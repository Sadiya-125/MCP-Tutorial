# MCP Teaching Repository

## Branch: v9-prompt-vs-mcp

This is **Lab 9 - Prompting vs MCP**: Empirically comparing long prompts with MCP-driven context.

### Key Changes from v8
- Added `experiments/` package with comparison tool
- Run side-by-side comparisons
- Measure token savings and consistency

### Commands
- `compare` - Run prompt vs MCP comparison
- `summary` - View comparison summary

### Why MCP Wins at Scale
- **Cost**: Fewer tokens needed
- **Reliability**: More consistent responses
- **Predictability**: Same context = same behavior
